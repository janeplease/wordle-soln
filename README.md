I coded a solution to solve the Wordle puzzle because I thought it would be a fun problem to solve. 

<h3>How to use it: </h3>

Currently works only on command line. 

1. Run the python script code.py to get your first word. Input the suggested word in your Wordle puzzle. 
2. Enter '!' corresponing to the letter tiles that turn yellow, '@' for the letter tiles that turn green and '#' for the letter tiles that are gray. 
3. You will be suggested a list of words that will satisfy the letters and tiles condition. Select one of these words and enter it into the Wordle puzzle. 
4. Repeat step 2.
5. Continue until you solve the puzzle!
